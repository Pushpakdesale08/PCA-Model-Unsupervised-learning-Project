# PCA-Model-Unsupervised-learning-Project

# Overview- 

This project demonstrates the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction in an unsupervised learning context. PCA is a powerful statistical technique used to extract key features from large datasets, simplifying data while retaining essential variance. This repository provides a detailed implementation of PCA using Python and showcases its use in exploratory data analysis and clustering tasks.

# Key Features-

Dimensionality Reduction: Reduce high-dimensional datasets into fewer components for easier visualization and analysis.

Data Visualization: Project data onto 2D/3D spaces for clear, interpretable visualizations.

Clustering Integration: Combine PCA with clustering algorithms (e.g. K-Means clustering) to identify underlying patterns.

Scalable Implementation: Works with large datasets using efficient computation methods.

Customizable Options: Adjust the number of principal components and variance thresholds as needed.
